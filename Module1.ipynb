    "NLP is a field of study in AI, and, as such, has several aspects:\n",
    "- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**: The ability to understand human language, including the meaning of words and sentences.\n",
    "- **Natural Language Generation (NLG)**: The ability to generate human language, including text and speech.\n",
